# Frontend Developer Guide

React single-page application for Codenames Online. This guide covers running the
frontend locally, the development and mock modes, and how to test every supported
flow without a backend.

Architecture, styling rules and contract sources are described in the
[repository README](../README.md). Detailed references:

- [Mock System](docs/MOCKS.md) — mock architecture, seeded data and the console API.
- [Testing Guide](docs/TESTING.md) — step-by-step manual test scenarios.

## Quick Start

Requirements: Node.js and npm. The repository pins no Node.js version; use a version
supported by Vite 7 (Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+). The package manager is npm
(`package-lock.json`).

Frontend only, with no backend (recommended for UI work):

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Then uncomment these lines in `.env`:

```dotenv
VITE_MOCK_API=true
VITE_MOCK_SOCKETS=true
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:5173> (the Vite default; Vite prints another port when 5173 is
busy). You are logged in as `player_one`. Every seeded account uses the password
`codenames42`.

Stop the server with `Ctrl+C`. Mock state lives in memory only: a page reload restores
the seed data (see [Resetting mock state](docs/MOCKS.md#resetting-mock-state)).

## Development Modes

| Mode                | How to activate                                                      | REST                                | Room and chat sockets               | Use                                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend development | `npm run dev`, mock variables unset                                  | Real Gateway through the Vite proxy | Real Gateway through the Vite proxy | Integration with the backend                                         |
| Full mock           | `npm run dev` with `VITE_MOCK_API=true` and `VITE_MOCK_SOCKETS=true` | In-memory mock                      | In-memory mock                      | Frontend work with no backend                                        |

| REST-only mock      | `npm run dev` with only `VITE_MOCK_API=true`                         | In-memory mock                      | Real Gateway                        | Rarely useful: the mock session cookie does not exist on the Gateway |
| Production build    | `npm run build`, then `npm run preview`                              | Same origin `/api`                  | Same origin `/ws`                   | Checking the shipped bundle                                          |

Details:

- **Backend development.** Vite proxies `/api` and `/ws` to `VITE_DEV_PROXY_TARGET`
  (default `http://localhost:3000`). The browser sees one origin, so the HttpOnly
  `ft_session` cookie reaches REST calls and WebSocket upgrades. The backend must be
  running.
- **Mock modes.** `src/main.tsx` installs the mocks before the first render. Each mock
  is a dynamic import guarded by `import.meta.env.DEV`, so it runs only under
  `npm run dev`. The mocks replace the transport only: the same API bindings, stores,
  reconnect logic and components run in every mode.
- **Production build.** `VITE_MOCK_*` variables are ignored. The mock code, the `/ui`
  gallery and the `mockApi` / `mockSockets` console objects are not in the bundle.
  `npm run preview` has no proxy, so `/api` and `/ws` calls fail unless a reverse proxy
  serves the build.

Change `.env`, then restart `npm run dev`. Vite reads `.env` only at startup.

## Environment Variables

All variables are optional. `.env.example` lists each one.

| Variable                  | Default                 | Scope                                      | Purpose                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VITE_DEV_PROXY_TARGET`   | `http://localhost:3000` | Dev server                                 | Gateway address the Vite proxy forwards `/api` and `/ws` to                   |
| `VITE_API_BASE_PATH`      | `/api`                  | All builds                                 | REST prefix. Override only for a non-same-origin setup                        |
| `VITE_WS_BASE_PATH`       | `/ws`                   | All builds                                 | WebSocket prefix. Same rule                                                   |
| `VITE_MOCK_API`           | unset                   | Development only                           | `true` answers every REST call from the mock REST server                      |
| `VITE_MOCK_AUTH`          | `logged-in`             | Development only, with `VITE_MOCK_API`     | Initial mock session: `logged-in`, `logged-out`, `in-room`, `session-expired` |
| `VITE_MOCK_SOCKETS`       | unset                   | Development only                           | `true` replaces the room and chat sockets with the mock servers               |
| `VITE_MOCK_ROOM_SCENARIO` | `room-waiting`          | Development only, with `VITE_MOCK_SOCKETS` | Scenario of a room socket for a room the mock REST server does not know       |

`VITE_*` values are inlined into the bundle. Never put a secret in one. Authentication
uses cookies only; the frontend has no API key, token or OAuth setting.

## Available Commands

The project has no automated test runner. Testing is manual, with the mocks. See the
[Testing Guide](docs/TESTING.md).

| REST error log           | Console, development only                    | Normalized REST failures (`devFlags.logApiErrors`)                        |

### Browser DevTools

- **Network.** In mock mode, REST calls and sockets never appear in the Network tab:
  they are answered in memory. Any `/api` or `/ws` request there goes to the real
  Gateway. With the backend, filter on `WS` and open the `/ws/v2/rooms/{id}` or
  `/ws/v2/channels` connection to read frames.
- **Console.** `mockApi` and `mockSockets` live here. Enable the Verbose level to see
  the `[mock api]` lines.
- **Application.** The only key the frontend stores is
  `localStorage["ft_transcendence.language"]` (`en`, `fr` or `tr`). The session lives in
  the HttpOnly `ft_session` and `ft_refresh` cookies, set by the real backend only.
