/**
 * The room route. It shows the screen that matches the server's `room.status` — the Ready
 * Room while the room waits or counts down, the Game Board once the game starts and its
 * result once it ends — so a refresh lands on the right screen from the fresh snapshot,
 * never from navigation history.
 *
 * Until the first snapshot arrives the route shows a loading state rather than an empty
 * room. A room that closed, or that the player no longer belongs to, clears the room from
 * the session; route recovery then takes the player to Room Discovery, where a toast says
 * what happened.
 *
 * Leaving is always explicit. LEAVE ROOM and LEAVE GAME ask first and tell the server, and
 * a Back or any other navigation away from the room is held for the same confirmation, so
 * nobody leaves a seat taken by nobody. A finished match has nothing left to confirm, so
 * leaving it, by Back to Lobby or by Back, tells the server and goes straight to the Lobby.
