/**
 * The one owner of the room WebSocket.
 *
 * That socket carries both `room.*` and `game.*` events, so exactly one connection
 * exists per room and both features read from it. Room and Game must never open their
 * own socket — two sockets would mean two competing views of authoritative state.
 *
 * This provider owns transport lifecycle, publishes connection status, and forwards
 * every event to the room and game stores. Leaving the room unmounts it, which closes
 * the socket and clears both stores so no stale member state survives the exit.
 *
 * It also owns recovery (`RoomRecovery`): a drop keeps the room on screen under the
 * Reconnecting overlay while the socket retries, and every reconnect rebuilds the room
 * from the server's fresh snapshot. When the room cannot be restored in time, the
 * player's room state is dropped and they go back to Room Discovery, where the
 * Disconnected notice says what happened. Their session is kept: a lost socket is not a
 * lost login.
