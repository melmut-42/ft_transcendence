/**
 * What the client does while the room socket is down.
 *
 * The socket itself keeps retrying with backoff (`ManagedSocket`) and a successful retry
 * brings a fresh `room.state` snapshot (`RoomConnection`). This controller adds what the
 * socket cannot see:
 *
 * - **The seat's deadline.** A drop from a live room starts the server's grace period. The
 *   client counts the same period from its own drop, publishes the deadline for the
 *   Reconnecting overlay, and gives up when it passes: by then the server has removed the
 *   member or ended the match by forfeit.
 * - **Why a handshake fails.** A browser is never told the HTTP status of a refused
 *   WebSocket upgrade, so a room that is gone, a membership that ended and an expired
 *   access cookie all look like a network drop. While the socket retries, a REST room
 *   snapshot tells them apart, at most once per `probeIntervalMs`. Its `401` also runs the
 *   REST client's silent refresh, which is how the contract renews the cookie the next
 *   handshake needs.
 * - **A first connection that never succeeds.** It stops after `firstConnectTimeoutMs`,
 *   so the room offers Try again instead of loading forever.
 *
 * The REST snapshot is only a check. The state the room is rebuilt from is always the
 * socket's own `room.state`, so events and the snapshot stay in one ordered stream.
