 * Route recovery: the screen comes from the server's view of the user's room membership,
 * never from the URL alone.
 *
 * `activeRoomId` mirrors `active_room_id` from `GET /api/auth/session` at bootstrap and is
 * kept current by entering and leaving rooms, so these guards hold every authenticated
 * route to it: a member is in their room, and a non-member is in the Lobby. Once inside the
 * room, the screen itself follows the authoritative `room.status` from the room snapshot.
 *
 * A guard explains itself only when the user arrived on the wrong route (a reload, a link,
 * a typed address). When the membership changes while the user is already on the route —
 * leaving, or a room that closed — whoever ended it says why, and the guard just follows.
