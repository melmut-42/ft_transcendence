/**
 * The signed-in user's own profile, from `GET /api/users/me`, shared by every view that
 * shows it: the profile menu on Room Discovery, the Ready Room and the Game Board, and
 * Settings.
 *
 * It is read once per signed-in user and then kept current by the server's answers to
 * the Settings actions — the updated profile from `PATCH /api/users/me` and the new
 * `avatar_url` from an upload or a preset pick — so a change shows everywhere at once,
 * without a reload. It never holds anything the server has not confirmed. Nothing is
 * persisted.
