/**
 * Auth REST bindings — Bruno `rest-api/01 - Identity/`.

 * These are contract bindings, nothing more: no flow, no redirect, no state write.
 * The authentication flow (form handling, session store writes, guard behavior) is
 * feature work that builds on top of them.
 *
 * All five calls authenticate by cookie. Register/Login/Refresh set `ft_session` and
 * `ft_refresh`; nothing here reads, stores or forwards a token, because no token value
 * is ever present in a response body.
